# Lab 3

This is a repository for Lab 3 representing my progress on Fullstack Development in 2023.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple HTML page with a Node.js MySQL connection.
It keeps track of the number of times you click a button and stores it in a database.
This is meant to show my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL.
